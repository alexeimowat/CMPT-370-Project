# Requirements

## Viewing / Non-Developer

To view the product **on your own machine**, [Docker](https://docker.com/) as well as Docker-Compose is required. 
### General
See [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for instructions getting Docker set up on your machine and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to setup Docker-Compose.
### Ubuntu 
 See [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) for how to install Docker on Ubuntu and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems) for how to install Docker-Compose

**Docker is how this project is intended to be run**

## Development 
**This is only if you're not using Docker**

The front-end is built on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/); therefore, you will need JavaScript enabled in your browser, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

# Cloning the Project

Whether you want to view the project (as marker, TA, etc.) or work on it, you will need to *clone* the project from the GitLab repository.

### Git Requirement

To do this, you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine - there's a good chance that it already is.

You can verify that git is installed by running:
```shell script
git --version
```
And you should receive output formatted as ``git version <VERSION_NUMBER>``; please ensure your version is *at least* **2.22.x** or newer.

### Cloning

Ensuring git is installed (see above), you are now ready to *clone* the project from the GitLab repository.

To view the project for the beta, run the following command:
```shell script
git clone --branch milestone-10 https://git.cs.usask.ca/brd171/370-project.git uplan 
```

To see the most recent version from the ``develop`` branch omit the ``--branch milestone-10`` option.

Then, change your *working directory* to be the root of the project:

```shell script
cd uplan
```

# Marker Setup

The steps described here do little more than set up port forwarding from your own machine to the Virtual Machine.

First enter tuxworld with
```shell script
ssh nsid@tux7.usask.ca
```

Now we set up a port forward from tuxworld to the virtual machine with
```shell script
ssh -N -f -L 3000:localhost:3000 user@CMPT370g3.usask.ca
ssh -N -f -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@CMPT370g3.usask.ca
```
These command might fail if someone else is port forwarding to tuxworld at the same time. This is most likely because someone in our project is already doing that however that's okay because it actually makes this step unnecessary!

Now exit away from tuxworld with ``exit`` and set up port forwarding from your machine to tuxworld.
```shell script
ssh -N -f -L 3000:localhost:3000 nsid@tux7.usask.ca
ssh -N -f -L 8000:localhost:8000 nsid@tux7.usask.ca
```
Where "nsid" is replaced with your own nsid. For this command you will need to supply your university password to get into tux7.

Once again enter your university password to access tuxworld. Now that that is done you can access the website in your browser by going to ``localhost:3000``


### Clean Up
This section stops the port forwards that we just set up.

First we close the port forward on your local machine to tuxworld. To do this we figure out the process id (PID) that our ssh command has. This is done with:
```shell script
ps aux | grep "ssh -N -f -L 3000:localhost:3000"
ps aux | grep "ssh -N -f -L 8000:localhost:8000"
```
The process we want to stop is the one that matches most closely to the command we did above in the set up. Take note of the PID which is the second column of the output. Knowing both of those PIDs we kill them with
```shell script
kill PID
```

Now SSH into tuxworld and do the same thing as above with the following. Note: If the first step of setting up the port forward failed then this is unnecessary, and potentially even **dangerous**. 
```shell script
ssh nsid@tuxworld.usask.ca
ps aux | grep "ssh -N -f -L 3000:localhost:3000"
ps aux | grep "ssh -N -f -L 8000:localhost:8000"
kill PID
```

With that we have shut down all the process we have created


# Viewing

This section outlines the process of preparing and running the project to view it; suitable for TAs, markers, presentations, etc.

## Requirements (Viewing)

The front-end is built on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/); therefore, you will need JavaScript enabled in your browser.

[Docker](https://docker.com/) is also required. 
* See [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for instructions getting Docker set up on your machine.
* To install on Ubuntu, see [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/).
 
## Setup (Viewing)

## Viewing Through the Virtual Machine

The steps described here do little more than set up port forwarding from your own machine to the Virtual Machine.

This is the simplest way to view the project. It is this convenient because the Virtual Machine is always running the server.

First set up port forwarding from your machine to tuxworld.
```shell script
ssh -N -f -L 3000:localhost:3000 nsid@tuxworld.usask.ca
```
Where "nsid" is replaced with your own nsid. For this command you will need to supply your university password to get into tuxworld.

Now enter tuxworld with
```shell script
ssh nsid@tuxworld.usask.ca
```
As before you will need to supply your university password to get into tuxworld.

Now we set up a port forward from tuxworld to the virtual machine with
```shell script
ssh -N -f -L 3000:localhost:3000 user@CMPT370g3.usask.ca
```
For this command you will need to supply the "user" password for the VM which can be seen either on our discord server, but will also be supplied to the markers of our project in a way that is to be determined.

Once again enter your university password to access tuxworld. Now that that is done you can access the website in your browser by going to ``localhost:3000``


### Clean Up
When you want to stop viewing the website you will find that port 3000 of localhost may be taken up. To stop that from happening you will need to stop the port forwards we set up before. This section describes who to do that.

First we close the port forward on your local machine to tuxworld. To do this we figure out the process id (PID) that our ssh command has. This is done with:
```shell script
ps aux | grep "ssh -N -f -L 3000:localhost:3000"
```
The process we want to stop is the one that matches most closely to the command we did above in the set up. Take note of the PID which is the second column of the output. Knowing that PID we kill it with
```shell script
kill PID
```

Now do the same thing with tuxworld. SSH into tuxworld like we've done before and do the same thing with
```shell script
ssh nsid@tuxworld.usask.ca
ps aux | grep "ssh -N -f -L 3000:localhost"
kill PID
```

With that we have shut down all the process we have created


## Viewing Without the Virtual Machine

Before the website is to be run, we will need to set a few things up with docker, and the database. To initialize docker, and do some minimal database set up, run:

```shell script
sudo docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
```

If this is your first time running this command, then it will take some time to complete; this is because docker will need to set up the required images.

Next, we need to populate the database. Run the following command:
```shell script
sudo docker-compose run web python manage.py loadData
```

Since the database is rather large, this will also take some time to set up. 

**Note**" *If this command ends on an error, saying ``index out of range``, then it still worked.* 

If this process is interrupted, any changes made to the database can be undone by re-running the previous command, replacing ``loadData`` with ``deleteData``.

## Running (Viewing)

Once the database is initialized we can start all of the necessary servers with the following command:
```shell script
sudo docker-compose up
```

After this is done, the web-page can be accessed by opening the web-page ``localhost:3000`` in a browser.

**Note**: If running successfully, your terminal running the Docker container will indicate the following:

```md
INFO: Accepting connections at http://localhost:80
```

This is not an error: ports are mapped (in the following command: ``3000:80``); view the page at ``http://localhost:3000/``, not ``http://localhost:80/``.

### Stopping the Docker Container 

Assuming the Docker container is currently running, the user can stop the container by entering ^C (that is, CTRL + C) in the terminal running the container.
Docker will indicate: ``INFO: Gracefully shutting down. Please wait...``.

# Running

This section concerns deploying the docker container, or running the project with Node. 

## Running the Docker Container

*Assuming the image has been built (see: [Setup](#Setup))*

Run:

```dockerfile
sudo docker run -p 3000:80 uplan
```

Now, the user can go to http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, to see the page running.

**Note**: If running successfully, your terminal running the Docker container will indicate the following:

```md
INFO: Accepting connections at http://localhost:80
```

This is not an error: ports are mapped (in the following command: ``3000:80``); view the page at ``http://localhost:3000/``, not ``http://localhost:80/``.

## Run the React Server

These steps concern running the project in development mode.

*This step assumes you have **installed node modules with ``npm install`` or ``yarn install`` already***.

Navigate to the ``react`` folder:
```shell_script
cd react
```

Run ``npm start`` or ``yarn start`` to run the app in the development mode; view it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Run the Backend Server

The (still in development) way of running the backend is entirely through docker-compose.

The first step is to navigate to the newDjango directory and run the following commands:
To initilize the database:
```bash
sudo docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
```
To get the data in the database: (this step will take awhile. If this crashes with an index out of range error then it still worked just not completly)
```bash
sudo docker-compose run web python manage.py loadData
```
To start the server:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```

## Stopping the Docker Container

Assuming the Docker container is currently running, the user can stop the container in one of two ways.

1. Press ^C (that is, CTRL + C) in the terminal running the container. Docker will indicate: ``INFO: Gracefully shutting down. Please wait...``.
2. In a *separate* terminal, perform the following:

See running Docker contains:
```shell script
docker ps
```

Find the column labelled ``IMAGE``, and the row with an ``IMAGE`` name of *uplan*. The right-most column, labelled ``NAMES`` will have a name that typically reads as <adjective_noun>. Identify this value, of the entry with an ``IMAGE`` name of *uplan*.

Run the following command, substituting <name> with the value identified in the previous step:
```shell script
docker stop <name>
```

The container should now be stopped.# Documentation

## Updating Documentation

The README is built from the individual markdown files in the the folder ``documentation``. To update the README, edit any of the files in the ``documentation`` folder, and then run the shell script (also located in the ``documentation`` folder):
```shell script
sh ./documentation/generate_readme.sh
```

# Speed/Performance Testing 
**Image results sourced from Virtual Machine**

The ideal way to test the Speed and Performance is to use your browser's included webdeveloper tools included in major browsers.
## Accessing benchmarking tools in Google Chrome/Chromium
hit *F12* to activate the elements view, from there you can check the *Performance* tab which let's you profile the time it takes to perform interactions, draw new objects or complete a page load.
![Chromium Page Load](performanceTestingImages/pageLoadChromium.png)
Here we can see that the time to load the page was *267ms*, a good result for us is a page load time below *400ms*.

*Memory* allows you to perform similar tests while checking that Garbage Collection is operating normally.
![Chromium Memory Output](performanceTestingImages/memoryoutputChromium.png)
Here I took a snapshot on pageload(*Snapshot 1*) and one after adding a few schedules, to demonstrate that the amount of memory use by the page will increase during use.
As long as the memory increases linearly with the introduction of more web elements memory use is normal.

The *Audits* tab is especially useful for comparing our product with expected performance among other webapps.
![Audit](performanceTestingImages/lighthouseScore.png)
Without dedicating time to optimization our goal is to keep our performance score above 60.

## Accessing benchmarking tools in Mozilla Firefox
To open up Firefox's elements view hit *Shift+F5* 

*Network* Is a responsiveness test that works for page load and other GET API requests.
![Network Performance on Firefox](performanceTestingImages/networkFirefoxTest.png)

under *500ms* seems to be a good timing for the DOMContentLoaded to receive the page contents and display.

*Performance* lets you profile the webpage and see which events cause major slowdowns in frames per second.
![Firefox Performance](performanceTestingImages/Performance&#32;page&#32;reload.png)
This view lets you look at the site's performance over time. In the images case a reload was requested and there is a notable slowdown while the page loads.

*Memory* Allows you to take a snapshot of the memory that has been currently allocated by the web page.
![Memory Allocation](performanceTestingImages/performanceAddingschedMemory.png)
Snapshot 1 demonstrates the state of memory after a page load and Snapshot 2 shows what happens when schedule objects are added.


# Back End Testing 

## Database Quality
For this test set we assume that you are viewing the project via the virtual machine, however it is very similar to do if it is running on your own machine. For these tests it is insufficient to log into the "user" of the VM since they don't have sudo permission. You could log into any of the but the easiest to work with is dev4.

Log into the VM from your own machine with
```shell script
ssh nsid@tuxworld.usask.ca
ssh dev4@CMPT370g3.usask.ca
```

When here go to the "370-project" directory then run a docker command to that scans through the database and checks for any suspicious behaviour
```shell script
cd ./370-project
sudo docker-compose run web python manage.py test
``` 
Here "test" is a custom command that does the following.

First it gets the number of entries in each table, and compares this against the number of entries that are expected. This ensures that there is no data missing, and no more than the ones that were scraped.

Next it checks for duplicate entries in every table. There should be no duplicate classes, professors, etc and this ensures that.

The last thing it does is check a few predetermined random lines from the database are actually in the database so that we know that the data we know is correct hasn't changed

## API Quality
For this test we still need to be in the virtual machine. We can do this from the "user" user, but the code is in dev4 so again it is simplest to login to that. These tests assume that the servers are running somewhere in the background.

From your desktop get to the VM with
```shell script
ssh nsid@tuxworld.usask.ca
ssh dev4@CMPT370g3.usask.ca
```

Navigate to the "tests" directory with:
```shell script
cd ~/370-project/newDjango/tests
```
Then run the API tests with
```shell script
python classApiTest.py
python programApiTest.py
```

These tests check the correctness and functionality of the API including the following.

Whether the API will give results at all when different parameters are passed to it. This ensures that each of the parameters actually work.

Whether the API will return a specific class in it's search results when it should

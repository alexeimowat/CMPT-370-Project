# CMPT-370-Project

Hello Reader!

This repo contains the source code from a group project I took part in while taking the Intro to Software Engineering course at the University of Saskatchewan.

In brief, the project is a student planner that allows students to plan their university schedules by adding courses to a dynamic calendar, there is far more detail about the project in its own documentation that we made when taking the course. 

The source code you see is our final deployed product. 

Thank you, have a nice day
Alex
